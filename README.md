## Keyboard Resources

This repository will be for storing any and all mechanical keyboard resources I come across.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ShaionMoghimi/KeyboardResources/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
